This project is a small autonomous robot car designed to avoid falling off edges. It uses two ultrasonic sensors, one on the left and one on the right, to continuously scan the ground in front of the car while it moves. The Arduino constantly compares the distance readings from both sensors. If the left sensor detects no floor, the car stops, reverses slightly, and turns to the right. If the right sensor detects no floor, it stops and turns to the left. If both sensors detect no floor, indicating an edge directly ahead, the car reverses and re-orients itself. Motor speed and direction are managed by an L298N motor driver. During development, I encountered several challenges, including sensors reacting slowly, motors jerking due to friction, a power cable detaching from the driver during early testing, and debugging logic that only worked when the wheels were in the air. After adjusting the distance thresholds, fixing wiring issues, re-soldering connections, and adding timing adjustments, the system now reliably navigates edges without falling. The wiring schematic can be found on the GitHub page. Additional time was spent performing maintenance on the car and correcting minor errors to ensure stable operation.
